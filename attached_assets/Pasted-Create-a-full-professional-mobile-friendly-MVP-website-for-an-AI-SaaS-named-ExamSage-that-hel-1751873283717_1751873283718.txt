Create a full professional, mobile-friendly MVP website for an AI SaaS named **"ExamSage"** that helps students convert long class notes into short, exam-ready answers.

💡 UI/UX Requirements:
- Clean, modern look like Notion or Grammarly
- Responsive, mobile-first layout
- Advanced CSS: animations, hover effects, toggles, neon glow on buttons
- Light/dark toggle
- Footer for privacy policy / contact

📄 Pages:
1. **Home Page** with headline: "Turn Notes into Exam Answers in Seconds"
   - Subheadline: "Paste your notes, get direct answers. Save time, score high."
   - CTA: "Try Now" → Scrolls to input form
   - Section for benefits (icons + text): Save Time, Better Scores, Zero Stress
   - Placeholder Ad section (divs with text "Ad Here")

2. **App Page** (on same site):
   - Textarea to paste notes
   - Dropdown to select subject
   - Slider to select answer length: Short | Medium | Long
   - Button: "Generate Answers"
   - Output section (mock data shown with AI-like animation)
   - Optional: Button to "Copy All Answers"
   - Placeholder for ad (div with text)

3. **About Page**
   - Brief about the tool, how it's free, how ads support it

4. **Contact Form (Mock)**

🧠 AI/Backend (MVP Version):
- No real OpenAI or API integration.
- When user clicks “Generate”, show mocked AI answers using JavaScript.
- Use `setTimeout` to mimic processing delay.
- All logic should be frontend-only, easily deployable on Netlify or Replit.
- Include comment placeholders to integrate API later.

📦 Tech Stack:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Optional: Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap
- No backend required (MVP)
- Use localStorage to save previous inputs (bonus)

📈 Other:
- SEO Meta Tags for “AI Exam Generator”, “Notes to Exam Answers”, “AI Tool for Students”
- Sitemap.xml & robots.txt placeholder
- Favicon with a book/AI icon

💰 Monetization Ready:
- Placeholder `<div>`s where AdSense can be placed
- Text: "Support this tool by checking our sponsors"

Deploy-ready: Should work without any backend; static site.
